      <p>
        I am a self-driven junior full-stack developer with a passion for
        creating innovative and user-friendly web applications. I am
        consistently enthusiastic about acquiring knowledge in areas that
        pertain to my field. In my free time, I enjoy reading articles and blogs
        about web development, as well as occasionally playing games with my
        friends.
